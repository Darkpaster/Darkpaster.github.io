# How Our Brain Sorts Information: A New Perspective on Its Processing

## Briefly on the Main Points

In this article, I propose a new way to look at how any information can be classified. Instead of complex technical or philosophical definitions, I start from **how information is processed by our brain**.

The model is based on five pairs of opposing characteristics:

1. **Objective / Subjective** (does it exist without us?)
2. **Primary / Derivative** (is it an instant reaction or the result of reflection?)
3. **External / Internal** (did it come from outside or originate in the head?)
4. **Conscious / Unconscious** (do we notice it or does it influence us subtly?)
5. **Holistic / Fragmentary** (is it part of a big picture or a separate element?)

This approach can be useful for neuroscience, psychology, and even for creating more advanced artificial intelligence.

## Why Do We Need a New Classification?

People have always tried to understand what information is and how it works. But often, it is divided into types without considering the most powerful computer for processing it — the human brain. I propose a **neurocentric approach**, that is, putting at the center exactly how the brain perceives and organizes data.

The main idea is that any information can be described using five fundamental pairs of opposites. They reflect how the brain relates to data: where it came from, how it changes over time, whether we are aware of it or not.

## Fundamentals of the Approach

The model is built on four simple principles:

1. **Everything is Interpretation.** Any information we can analyze has already passed through the "filters" of our brain.
2. **Multilevel Processing.** The brain processes data at different levels: from simple reactions to complex thoughts.
3. **Everything is Constantly Changing.** Informational processes in the brain are not static; they are in constant motion.
4. **Context Decides Everything.** How we understand information depends on our current state and surroundings.

This approach combines ideas from several modern theories on consciousness, memory function, and prediction, creating a unified system for understanding information.

## Five Ways the Brain Divides Information

### 1. Objective vs. Subjective Information (Dependence on the Observer)

**Objective Information** — this is essentially "information in a vacuum." It exists in the physical world regardless of whether there is someone who can perceive it. For example, radio waves in space. We can never gain direct access to it because any perception of ours is already an interpretation.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** Nothing. By definition, the brain does not process this information.

**Subjective Information** — this is everything we know and feel. It is born the moment our brain interacts with the world. Its diversity is infinite, as every living being has its own unique system of perception.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** The entire nervous system is involved: from skin receptors to the most complex areas of the cerebral cortex.

### 2. Primary vs. Derivative Information (Temporal Dynamics)

**Primary Information** — this is an instantaneous, "raw" reaction to what is happening right now. This is the first wave of data processing. Imagine seeing a bright flash of light — that's primary information.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** Areas responsible for primary perception (e.g., visual cortex) are activated, which are the first to receive signals from the senses.

**Derivative Information** — this is everything that happens next. This is the result of processing primary information: our memories, conclusions, predictions, emotions. In the example with the flash, the thought "It's probably lightning, a storm is about to start" — that's already derivative information.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** Associative areas of the cortex, the hippocampus (memory center), and the prefrontal cortex (center for planning and thinking) are engaged.

### 3. External vs. Internal Information (Source)

**External (Exogenous) Information** comes to us from the surrounding world through the senses. The sound of a passing car, the smell of coffee, the sight of a tree outside the window — all these are examples of external information.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** Sensory systems (vision, hearing, smell) are activated in response to external stimuli.

**Internal (Endogenous) Information** originates right in our head without any external trigger. These are our thoughts, dreams, memories, plans for the evening. When you just sit and ponder something — you are generating internal information.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** This is the result of spontaneous activity in neural networks, for example, the so-called "default mode network," which is active when we are not focused on anything specific.

---

### 4. Conscious vs. Unconscious Information (Accessibility)

**Conscious (Accessible) Information** — this is what we can think about and describe. We can use it for decision-making and analysis. If asked what you had for breakfast and you answer — you are using conscious information.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** It is believed to be handled by the so-called "global workspace" — a broad network of neurons that integrates data from different parts of the brain, especially from the prefrontal cortex.

**Unconscious (Inaccessible) Information** is also processed by the brain, but we are not aware of it. Nevertheless, it influences our behavior. For example, an ad you glimpsed might affect your choice in a store, even if you didn't remember it.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** This is the work of automatic, "subthreshold" processes in sensory and subcortical structures.

---

### 5. Holistic vs. Fragmentary Information (Integration)

**Holistic (Integrated) Information** is perceived by us as part of something larger. We see connections between different elements and fit them into the overall picture of the world. For example, understanding how a grammar rule relates to a specific sentence.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** Synchronous activity of neurons in different, distant brain areas is observed. Connections between them are strengthened.

**Fragmentary (Elementary) Information** is perceived as a separate, basic fact, not currently connected to anything else. For example, you memorized an unfamiliar word but don't yet know its meaning and can't associate it with anything.
* **What Happens in the Brain?** Activity is observed in one specialized brain area (module), without strong connections to other regions.

## Where Can This Be Useful?

### Science and Psychology
This classification helps better understand how consciousness, memory, and perception work. With it, we can more accurately study different states of consciousness (e.g., sleep or meditation) and cognitive impairments.

### Artificial Intelligence
By understanding how the brain sorts information, we can create more effective neural networks for AI that process data in a more "human-like" way.

### Medicine
Such a model can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, which are often related precisely to disruptions in information processing (e.g., schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorders).

## What Is Still Unclear and What to Do Next?

Of course, this model has limitations. It is based on our current knowledge of the brain, which is constantly being updated. Additionally, some concepts (especially "objective information") remain purely theoretical.

## In Conclusion

This is a relatively new way of classifying information that puts the brain itself at the center. The five described "filters" allow for a comprehensive description of how our brain works with any data. The main advantage of this approach is that it can be tested experimentally by studying brain activity. This model can become the basis for new research at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and computer science, bringing us closer to unraveling the mystery of consciousness.
