# Science, the Scientific Method, and Scientific Thinking

## 1. Introduction

“If we are to name as divine everything we don’t understand, how much of the divine will there be?” — this question, posed by Carl Sagan, captures the essence of the scientific approach to understanding the world. Science is not merely a collection of facts or dogmas, but a dynamic process of constantly revising our representations of reality.

In the modern world, where information spreads at unprecedented speed and pseudoscientific theories often disguise themselves as serious research, understanding the nature of science and the scientific method becomes critically important not only for scientists but for every educated person.

This work aims to explore the fundamental principles of scientific inquiry, analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the traditional scientific method, and consider alternative approaches to rational thinking in situations where classical science proves powerless.

## 2. The Nature and Definition of Science

### 2.1. An Evolutionary Perspective on Science

Richard Feynman offers an evolutionary understanding of science: “On our planet, in the course of the evolution of life, intelligent beings appeared… Gradually they developed until some creatures learned to acquire experience more quickly and even pass it on to others.” This process of accumulating knowledge, which Feynman calls “time-binding,” became the foundation for the emergence of science.

However, the mere accumulation of knowledge contained a fundamental problem: “Along with useful ideas, harmful ones were also passed on.” Science arose as a response to this problem — as a way to separate reliable knowledge from prejudice and error.

### 2.2. Defining Science Through Skepticism

According to Feynman, **the essence of science lies in recognizing that everything should be rechecked through new experience, rather than unquestioningly believed based on the legacy of the past**. This definition highlights the fundamentally critical nature of the scientific approach.

Feynman also offers a provocative definition: **“Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.”** This does not mean rejecting authority but rather emphasizing that in science, authority is not the final argument. When someone says “science claims,” the better question to ask is: “How exactly was this established? By what methods? Where can the original sources be found?”

### 2.3. Science as a Source of Spirituality

It is important to note that scientific inquiry does not contradict the spiritual needs of humans. As Sagan emphasizes: “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.” Understanding that “trees are made mostly of air” and that “the heat released in a flame is sunlight that once helped the air become a tree” reveals a beauty and wonder of the world inaccessible to superficial observation.

## 3. The Structure and Principles of the Scientific Method

### 3.1. The Classical Scientific Method

Traditionally, the scientific method is described through a hypothetico-deductive scheme:

1. **Observation** — identifying common features in observed events
2. **Formulating questions** — determining what needs explanation
3. **Hypothesis formulation** — proposing a mechanism for the phenomenon
4. **Deduction of predictions** — logically deriving consequences from the hypothesis
5. **Experimental testing** — controlled testing of predictions
6. **Analysis of results** — comparing data with predictions

### 3.2. Example: Sagan’s Hypothesis on Venus

A classic example of the successful application of the scientific method is Carl Sagan’s prediction about the climate of Venus. In 1960, when prevailing views held that Venus might be suitable for life, Sagan hypothesized that the planet’s surface was dry and extremely hot.

This hypothesis was:

* **Specific** — predicted a temperature of about 500°C
* **Falsifiable** — could be disproven by measurements
* **Testable** — allowed for experimental verification

In 1962, the Mariner 2 space probe confirmed Sagan’s forecast, marking a triumph of scientific foresight.

### 3.3. The Role of Observation and Experiment

It is important to understand that in science, observations and questions are interconnected: “Questions determine observations, but observations also determine questions — in fact, they should be considered exclusively together.” Science deals solely with the natural world — “atoms, people, galaxies, society, plants” — while the supernatural lies beyond the scope of scientific investigation.

## 4. Problems of Verification and Falsification

### 4.1. Popper’s Criterion

Karl Popper introduced the concept of **falsifiability** as a criterion for scientific theories. A scientific hypothesis must make specific predictions that can, in principle, be disproven by experiment. This does not mean that a falsifiable hypothesis is necessarily true — for example, the claim “the Sun is made entirely of pistachio ice cream” meets Popper’s criterion but is clearly false.

### 4.2. Russell’s Teapot

Bertrand Russell illustrated the problem of unfalsifiable claims with his famous analogy: “If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the Sun in an elliptical orbit… no one could disprove my assertion if I added that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes.”

Russell’s Teapot demonstrates a fundamental principle: **the burden of proof lies on the one making the claim, not on the one refuting it**. The unfalsifiability of a claim does not make it true or even plausible.

### 4.3. The Problem of Induction

The scientific method often relies on inductive reasoning — moving from specific observations to general laws. However, induction does not logically guarantee the truth of conclusions. Even repeated confirmation of a hypothesis does not prove it definitively — alternative explanations always exist.

Moreover, the same experimental data can support multiple contradictory theories. For example, Lavoisier’s experiments with mercury oxide could be explained both within the oxygen theory and within the phlogiston theory when supplemented with suitable auxiliary hypotheses.

## 5. The Limits of the Scientific Method and the Role of Rationality

### 5.1. When Science Is Powerless

Eliezer Yudkowsky raises an important problem: what to do in situations where the traditional scientific method cannot yet provide an answer? There are questions of enormous importance that cannot currently be tested experimentally but still require rational consideration.

Examples include:

* **Cryonics** — the possibility of preserving a person through freezing and future revival
* **Macroscopic quantum superpositions** — the behavior of quantum systems at the macroscopic level
* **Evolutionary psychology** — many of its hypotheses cannot be directly tested

### 5.2. The Bayesian Approach

In such cases, the Bayesian approach to evaluating hypotheses becomes useful. The key principle: **absence of evidence is evidence of absence only when evidence is expected**.

For example:

* If snake oil truly cured cancer, we would expect numerous successful studies
* But the absence of transitional fossil forms does not disprove evolution, because fossilization is extremely rare

### 5.3. The Example of Cryonics

Let us consider cryonics as an example of rational analysis in the absence of direct evidence. Traditional science might say: “Not proven — therefore it doesn’t work.” But this is a misapplication of the scientific method.

From a Bayesian perspective, it is important to note:

* There are no fundamental physical barriers to restoring frozen tissues
* The absence of successful revivals is explained by technological limitations, not by inherent impossibility
* Information-theoretic death (destruction of brain structure) is different from clinical death

## 6. Pseudoscience and Scientific Thinking

### 6.1. Signs of Pseudoscience

Feynman warns of the dangers of pseudoscience — the imitation of scientific methods without understanding their essence. Main signs of a pseudoscientific approach:

1. **Copying form without substance** — conducting experiments, compiling statistics without understanding the purpose
2. **Lack of self-criticism** — unwillingness to subject one’s ideas to serious testing
3. **Seeking confirmation instead of refutation** — selectively choosing supporting data

### 6.2. Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions

Yudkowsky identifies four hallmarks of pseudoscientific explanations:

1. **The explanation acts as a stopper for curiosity**, not as a predictive tool
2. **The hypothesis has no moving parts** — the mystery is attributed to an indivisible essence
3. **The authors cherish their ignorance**, boasting that the phenomenon “transcends ordinary science”
4. **After the explanation, the phenomenon remains just as mysterious** as before

A classic example is Roger Penrose’s attempt to explain consciousness through “quantum gravity.” Even if this hypothesis were correct, it would not explain why the brain thinks “I think, therefore I am,” or why the color red appears as it does.

### 6.3. Media and the Spread of Pseudoscience

Modern media facilitate the spread of pseudoscientific ideas. As the editor-in-chief of *Weekly World News* put it: “We’re a tabloid — why would we give up a good story?” Skeptical analysis doesn’t boost circulation, so outlets prefer sensational but unreliable material.

The problem is compounded by the fact that “those pedantically sticking to verified facts” lose audience share to less scrupulous competitors.

## 7. Cognitive Biases in Scientific Inquiry

### 7.1. The Problem of Human Rationality

Thomas Gilovich, in *How We Know What Isn’t So*, demonstrates systematic errors of human thinking:

* Confusion with numbers and statistics
* Dismissing inconvenient evidence
* Susceptibility to external influence

Particularly dangerous is the tendency “to seek and fit evidence to our desires, discarding that which contradicts them.”

### 7.2. Motivated Reasoning

People are prone to **motivated reasoning** — seeking arguments to support a desired conclusion rather than objectively evaluating evidence. This manifests in:

* Selective attention to confirming facts
* Ignoring contradicting data
* Double standards in evaluating sources

### 7.3. The Role of Emotions and Desires

“The more intensely we want to believe, the greater the care that is required,” warns Thomas Huxley. Strong emotional preferences distort the evaluation of evidence. Therefore, it is critically important to:

* Recognize one’s own biases
* Actively seek refuting data
* Engage independent critics

## 8. Science and Society: Challenges of the Modern Era

### 8.1. Social Consequences of Anti-Scientific Thinking

History knows tragic examples of rejecting rational thinking. The *Malleus Maleficarum* (1487) — “one of the most terrifying documents in human history” — shows what happens when dogmas and prejudices replace evidence.

### 8.2. Challenges for Education

Feynman warns: “We live in an unscientific age in which almost all the machinery of communication — television, words, books — is unscientific.” This creates special challenges for education:

* How to distinguish science from its imitation?
* How to develop critical thinking in the age of information overload?
* How to resist “intellectual tyranny done in the name of science”?

### 8.3. The Role of Expertise

A paradox of modern society: on the one hand, knowledge is becoming increasingly specialized; on the other — distrust of experts is growing. As Sagan asks: “By the way, how does society reward those who question its social and economic dogmas?”

It is important to distinguish healthy skepticism from blanket rejection of expert knowledge.

## 9. Conclusion

Studying the nature of science, the scientific method, and scientific thinking leads to several key conclusions:

### 9.1. Science as a Process, Not a Dogma

Science is not a set of immutable truths but a dynamic process of constantly checking and revising our understanding of the world. As Ann Druyan emphasizes, science continually “whispers to the human being: remember, you’re not as good at this as you think.”

### 9.2. Limitations of the Traditional Scientific Method

Although the hypothetico-deductive method remains the foundation of scientific inquiry, it has significant limitations:

* Not all important questions are experimentally testable
* Induction does not logically guarantee truth
* Alternative explanations are always possible

### 9.3. The Necessity of Rational Thinking

In situations where traditional science is powerless, rational thinking based on the Bayesian approach comes to the rescue. Key principles:

* Assessing the prior probability of hypotheses
* Distinguishing between “not proven” and “false”
* Considering context when interpreting absence of evidence

### 9.4. The Importance of Critical Thinking

Fighting pseudoscience and cognitive biases requires developing critical thinking:

* The ability to distinguish form from substance in the scientific method
* Willingness to question even appealing ideas
* Understanding the limits of applicability of different methods of inquiry

### 9.5. Social Responsibility

Science does not exist in a vacuum — it is inseparably linked to society. Understanding the principles of scientific thinking is critical for:

* Making informed decisions under uncertainty
* Resisting manipulation and misinformation
* Preserving rational discourse in public life

### 9.6. Balancing Skepticism and Openness

As Feynman notes, passing knowledge to future generations requires “a delicate balance between respect and skepticism.” We must “teach and accept the past, and doubt it — and this balance requires great skill.”

### 9.7. Prospects for Development

The future of scientific inquiry will likely be characterized by:

* Integrating traditional scientific methods with Bayesian approaches
* Developing interdisciplinary research
* Using artificial intelligence to process large datasets
* New forms of collective cognition

**Final Thought**

“There’s plenty of wonders in the universe without inventing any,” Sagan reminds us. Scientific inquiry does not impoverish the world but reveals its true beauty and complexity. Understanding the principles of science and rational thinking is not just an academic task but a necessary condition for navigating the complexity of the modern world.

Of all disciplines, only science “contains within itself the lesson that the greatest teachers of the past can be wrong.” This lesson of humility before the complexity of the world, of readiness to revise one’s beliefs, and of striving for truth remains as relevant as ever.
