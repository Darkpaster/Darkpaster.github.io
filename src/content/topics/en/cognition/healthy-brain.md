# Comprehensive Guide to Brain Health

## Introduction: The Brain as a Complex Ecosystem

Our brain is an entire ecosystem of 86 billion neurons forming quadrillions of synaptic connections. It is a dynamic network that simultaneously serves as the body's control center, memory storage, generator of consciousness and creativity, as well as a sensitive barometer of our physical and emotional state.

Modern neuroscience shows that brain health depends on a multitude of interconnected factors: from the quality of the air we breathe to the depth of our social connections. Every aspect of our life — physical activity, nutrition, sleep, stress, social interactions, mental challenges, even lighting and sound environment — affects neuroplasticity and cognitive functions.

## Biological Maladaptation to Modern Lifestyle

### Evolutionary Perspective: The Hunter's Brain in the World of Offices

Homo sapiens as a species formed about 300,000 years ago. For 99.9% of its history, humans led an active lifestyle in a diverse natural environment. Our genes, neural networks, and metabolic systems are optimized for:

- **Constant Movement**: 20-25 km of walking per day
- **Diverse Physical Activity**: Climbing, running, carrying heavy loads, throwing
- **Complex Sensory Environment**: Sounds of nature, natural lighting, variety of smells and textures
- **Social Cooperation**: Small groups of 50-150 people with deep connections
- **Periodic Stresses**: Short-term threats with full recovery
- **Natural Circadian Rhythms**: Synchronization with sunlight

The modern lifestyle radically differs:

- 12-14 hours of sitting per day
- Monotonous sensory environment (screens, artificial lighting, noise)
- Social isolation and superficial digital connections
- Chronic stress without physical discharge
- Disrupted circadian rhythms

### Consequences of Mismatch for the Brain

**Neurovascular Impairments**: With prolonged sitting, blood flow to the brain decreases by 20-30%, limiting the supply of oxygen and glucose — the main fuel for neurons.

**Inflammatory Cascade**: Hypodynamia activates microglia (brain immune cells), triggering chronic inflammation that damages neurons and disrupts synaptic transmission.

**Impaired Neurogenesis**: In the hippocampus — a key memory structure — the formation of new neurons practically ceases, which is critical for learning and adaptation.

**Neurotransmitter Imbalance**: Production of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine decreases, affecting motivation, mood, and attention.

**Structural Changes**: MRI studies show a decrease in gray matter volume, cortical thinning, especially in prefrontal areas responsible for executive functions.

## Why People in the Past Were Cognitively More Successful

### Reverse Flynn Effect: An Alarming Trend

Since the 1970s, average IQ in developed countries has been declining by 0.3-0.5 points per year. At the same time, the frequency of ADHD, anxiety disorders, depression, and dementia among youth is growing.

### Cognitive Advantages of Active Historical Lifestyle

**Spatial Navigation**: People in the past solved complex spatial tasks daily, developing the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Modern use of GPS atrophies these areas.

**Multisensory Integration**: Craftsmen, farmers, hunters constantly processed information from all senses simultaneously, developing interhemispheric connections and sensorimotor integration.

**Social Intelligence**: Survival depended on the ability for complex social coordination, reading emotions, long-term planning in a group.

**Physical Diversity**: Hundreds of different movements daily developed the motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.

**Cognitive Flexibility**: Constant changes in conditions required quick adaptation, switching between tasks, creative problem-solving.

## 1. Physical Activity: Foundation of Neuroplasticity

### Molecular Mechanisms

**BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)**: Aerobic exercises increase its production by 3-5 times. BDNF:

- Stimulates growth of dendrites and axons
- Increases the number of synapses
- Protects neurons from apoptosis
- Improves synaptic plasticity

**VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)**: Stimulates the growth of new capillaries in the brain, improving blood supply by 15-20%.

**IGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor)**: Especially activated by strength training, promotes neuron survival and myelination.

### Specific Effects of Different Types of Activity

**Aerobic Exercises** (running, swimming, cycling):

- Maximum neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
- Increase in prefrontal cortex volume by 2-3%
- Improvement in executive functions by 10-15%
- Increase in information processing speed

**High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**:

- Maximum BDNF production
- Improvement in working memory
- Increase in cognitive flexibility
- Stress resilience

**Strength Training**:

## Conclusion: Integrative Approach to Brain Health

Brain health is not the result of one factor but the synergy of many interconnected elements. Each component of this guide is important, but their combination creates a powerful cumulative effect.

### Key Principles

**Holistic Approach**: The brain functions as part of the holistic body system. It is impossible to optimize cognitive functions while ignoring physical health, emotional state, or social environment.

**Evolutionary Compatibility**: Our brain evolved for an active, diverse, social lifestyle. Returning to these basic principles is the key to cognitive health.

**Progressiveness and Consistency**: Neuroplasticity requires constant challenge and progression. The brain adapts to loads, so it is important to constantly increase task complexity.

**Individualization**: Every brain is unique. An effective program must consider genetic features, current health state, preferences, and life circumstances.

**Long-Term Perspective**: Changes in the brain occur slowly. It is necessary to plan the program for months and years, not weeks.

### Hierarchy of Priorities

1. **Physical Activity** — basic stimulator of neuroplasticity
2. **Quality Sleep** — time for recovery and consolidation
3. **Nutrition** — building material and fuel for neurons
4. **Stress Management** — prevention of damage
5. **Social Connections** — emotional support and stimulation
6. **Cognitive Challenges** — directed development of functions
7. **Environment Optimization** — creation of supportive conditions
