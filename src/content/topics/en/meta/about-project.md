## What is this project?

"HumanityOS" is an attempt to create an alternative system for understanding the world, based on critical analysis and logical thinking, with the goal of contributing to the fight against obscurantism, ignorance, xenophobia, and other problems.

## Project Goals

### Primary

1.  **To systematize knowledge** about the problems of modern society and their solutions, so there is no longer a need to gather fragmented information from various sources.
2.  **To propose possible solutions and alternatives** based on scientific data.
3.  **To document ideas** on possible ways to educate the population.

### Secondary

- To develop "critical" and "rational" thinking.
- To create a community of like-minded individuals.
- To help those who feel out of sync with generally accepted norms.

## Operating Principles

### Scientific Approach

- All statements must be substantiated.
- Sources of information are cited.
- Controversial hypotheses are marked accordingly.

### Practicality

- Focus on applicable solutions.
- Avoidance of abstract philosophizing.
- Concrete proposals for improving systems.

### Honesty

- Acknowledgment of the limits of one's own knowledge.
- Openness to criticism and corrections.
- Rejection of dogmatism.
